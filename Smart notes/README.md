# Smart Notes

Rich text note-taking application with tagging and theme support. Notes are stored in `notes.json` and settings in `settings.json` (both ignored by git).

## Features

- Create, edit and delete notes
- Bold, italic, underline and color formatting
- Tags for filtering and a search bar
- Dark/light mode toggle
- JSON persistence for notes and settings

## Usage

```
python smart_notes.py
```

The interface splits the notes list and the editor. Use **+ New** to create a note, **Save Note** to store changes and the moon/sun button to switch themes.
